# Search Web

This skill enhances your ability to find information online.

## Workflow

1.  **Formulate Query**:
    *   Think about exactly what you need. Is it "how to install X"? "error code Y"? "best practice for Z"?
    *   Use specific keywords. Avoid natural language questions if keywords are more precise.
2.  **Execute Search**:
    *   Use the `search_web` tool.
    *   If looking for code examples, append specific sites like `site:stackoverflow.com` or `site:github.com`.
    *   If looking for docs, append `documentation` or `api reference`.
3.  **Analyze Results**:
    *   Read the tool output carefully.
    *   If the first search yields nothing, refine the query. Don't give up immediately.
    *   Synthesize the information found into your next step.

## Tips
*   Don't guess API methods; search for them.
*   If you see an error, search the *exact* error message (minus variable parts like file paths).
